 Soundcloud is a music and podcast streaming platform that lets you upload, share and discover content. With Soundcloud, you can create and share your own playlists, or listen to other users` playlists. You can also follow other users to see what they are listening to, and repost their tracks to share them with your followers. Soundcloud also has a podcast section where you can find new podcasts to listen to, or submit your own podcast for others to hear. Soundcloud is free to use, but there are paid options that give you access to more features. If you are a musician or podcast creator, Soundcloud is a great way to get your content out there and heard by millions of people.

<h2>How Soundcloud Works</h2>
Soundcloud is very easy to use. If you are a musician or podcaster, you can upload your content onto the site for others to listen to. Once your content is uploaded, you can share it on other social media platforms, or embed it onto your website or blog. If you are just looking for new music or podcasts to listen to, you can browse the site and find something that interests you. You can also follow other users so that their content appears in your feed, and like or comment on their tracks. If you find a track that you really like, you can repost it onto your own profile so that your followers can listen to it as well. There is also a search bar so that you can look for specific tracks or artists. 

<h2>Soundcloud Pro</h2>
Soundcloud offers a paid subscription called Soundcloud Pro. For $9.99/month, you get access to additional features such as increased upload time (up to 6 hours per track), advanced stats, and custom branding options. You also get an ad-free listening experience and priority customer support. If you are serious about promoting your music or podcasts on Soundcloud, upgrading to Pro is definitely worth considering.
